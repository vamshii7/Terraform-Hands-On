## 📦 Description

**Terraform-Hands-On** is a curated lab for mastering infrastructure automation using **Terraform** on **Azure Cloud**, integrated with **Azure DevOps Pipelines**. It’s built for experimentation, learning, and collaboration — with modular examples and real-world CI/CD workflows.

---

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites
- ✅ [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed and added to your system `PATH`
- ✅ Azure CLI configured (`az login`)
- ✅ Azure DevOps organization and project
- ✅ Self-hosted agent (e.g., VirtualBox VM) or Microsoft-hosted agent

### Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vamshii7/Terraform-Hands-On.git
cd Terraform-Hands-On

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Validate configuration
terraform validate

# Plan and apply
terraform plan
terraform apply

## 🧠 Concepts

This repo covers key infrastructure and DevOps concepts:

- 🔧 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with modular Terraform  
- ☁️ Azure resource provisioning (VMs, Storage, Networking)  
- 📦 Terraform state management and remote backends  
- 🧩 Kubernetes integration (AKS, HPA, NetworkPolicy)  
- 🔒 Role-based access and secure secrets handling  

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD — Azure DevOps

This project uses **Azure Pipelines** for automated provisioning and validation:

- 🧾 `azure-pipelines.yml` — pipeline for Terraform deployment  
- 🔐 Secrets managed via Azure DevOps variable groups  
- 🧹 Linting, validation, and plan previews  
- 🌸 Auto-cleanup and state locking  

> Self-hosted agents are supported with Terraform binary symlinking and environment setup.

---

## ⏰ Roadmap

Planned enhancements:

- [x] Modular Terraform structure  
- [x] Azure DevOps pipeline integration  
- [ ] AKS cluster provisioning with HPA and RBAC  
- [ ] Helm chart deployment via Terraform  
- [ ] Monitoring with Azure Insights
